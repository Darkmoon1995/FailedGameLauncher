# FailedGameLauncher
## The idea
I wanted to make game launcher (I know C is not good option\) 
I wanted to find all the steam files and based on guess all the games 
IT KINDA WORKS BUTTTTT
if you add game and remove it will add file to ~/Steam/appcache/stats and i that is big BUG that i dont think there is way to fix
The best option would have been to try to get the games by asking for the user details But i didnt want that.
Well I tryed :D
Also if you know a better way to know which games has been removed or added please gmail my at 
Thanks
